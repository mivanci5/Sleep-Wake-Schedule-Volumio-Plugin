Volumio Sleep-Wake Schedule Plugin
Overview
The Volumio Sleep-Wake Schedule Plugin is designed to enhance your Volumio experience by adding sleep and wake-up automation features. This plugin allows you to schedule when Volumio should fade out the volume and stop playback at night and when it should gradually increase the volume and start a specific playlist in the morning.

Features
Sleep Mode: Automatically fades out the volume and stops playback at a specified time.
Wake Mode: Gradually increases the volume and starts a playlist at a set wake-up time.
Configurable Volume Levels: Set the desired volume level for wake-up.
Flexible Scheduling: Define sleep and wake times to fit your routine.
Easy Configuration: Intuitive UI for setting sleep and wake parameters.
